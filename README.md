# Tala Hydro Power Project Hydraulic Simulation
## Project Overview:

This project simulates the MIV (Main Inlet Valve) system of the Tala Hydro Power Plant, replicating its closure behavior under various input parameters. It achieves this using a hydraulic simulation model.

### Key Features:

* Takes in diverse input parameters from the simulation environment.
* Generates outputs that reflect the MIV system's response to those inputs.

#### Captures the essence of four critical valves within the MIV system:
* Bypass Valve
* MIV Valve
* Decompression Valve
* Service Seal Valve

### Components:
The model itself resides within the components folder.
Additional supporting files and documentation might be located elsewhere in the project structure
